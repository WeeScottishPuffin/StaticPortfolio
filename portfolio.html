        Hey! I'm Naut van der Winden, but you might know me by my online aliases "ScottishPuffin" or "SirMrMacTavish"
        I am a Software Development student from the Netherlands. I rather enjoy programming, gaming and walking. I also like old (60's-80's) music, along with some obscure-<i>ish</i>
        late-soviet/early russian music. My favourites among them being КИНО (Kino) and Фристайл (Freestyle). The main thing that draws me to programming, is being able to solve problems.
        I really enjoy solving problems in my own way, and just trying stuff out.<br><br>
        I've been coding since I was about 10, first starting with <i>very</i> rudementary <span class="highlight">html</span>. Later I learned python and played around with <span class="highlight">Raspberry Pi SBCs</span>.
        My fascination of coding was there to stay during my highschool time, and I've probably spent more time programming during school time than paying attention.
        It was often hard to find motivation for projects though, so I have rather little to show for it.<br><br>
        As of now, I am studying to get certificates. I hope to work in the gaming industry, and have a dream to release my own game as an solo game developer.
        With that being said, I do look forward to working in the IT industry in general.  
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub">This site</h2>
      <p>
        My first portfolio was a static GitHub Pages site in early 2020. Later I swapped to a <span class="highlight">Flask</span> site to easily add projects by way of a dynamic website.
        However, this was harder and more expensive to host and thus I switched to another static site (<a href="https://old.scottishpuff.in">old.scottishpuff.in</a>).
        I didn't quite like the design, and the functionality was quite limited.
        After all this, I made a new site using <span class="highlight">Flask</span>, starting from the ground up. This time, I hosted it via replit.
        Because of the hosting changes on replit, I gave up for some time, before switching back to GitHub Pages.
        This time, I used <span class="highlight">HTML/CSS/JS</span> in favour of a dynamic <span class="highlight">Flask</span> site.<br><br>
        I still needed a way to easily add projects without using too much space, so I cobbled together a way to generate pages based on a <span class="highlight">HTML</span> template and a <span class="highlight">JSON</span> file.
        That is how this current site came to be, and I am still working on it (partly as a passion project).
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub">Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I can currently confidently code in <span class="highlight">python</span> and built simple websites with <span class="highlight">html</span>, <span class="highlight">css</span> and <span class="highlight">javascript</span>.
        I have made projects with <span class="highlight">Java</span> and <span class="highlight">C-Sharp</span> in the past, and plan on learning more about <span class="highlight">C-Sharp</span>.
        My next step, is getting certificates for these languages and building more projects using them, to showcase my competence.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub">Certificates</h2>
      <p>
        I currently do not posses a lot of certificates, but I did start with some basic ones. I plan on getting professional level certificates in <span class="highlight">Python</span> and <span class="highlight">C Sharp</span>.

      <p>
        What? You already expect 20 years of experience for that junior-level job? Still working on it, I'm afraid.
