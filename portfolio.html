        Hey! I'm Naut van der Winden, but you might know me by my online aliases "ScottishPuffin" or "SirMrMacTavish"
        I am a Software Development student from the Netherlands. I rather enjoy programming, gaming and walking. I also like old (60's-80's) music, along with some obscure-<i>ish</i>
        late-soviet/early russian music. My favourites among them being КИНО (Kino) and Фристайл (Freestyle). The main thing that draws me to programming, is being able to solve problems.
        I really enjoy solving problems in my own way, and just trying stuff out.<br><br>
        I've been coding since I was about 10, first starting with <i>very</i> rudementary <span class="highlight">html</span>. Later I learned python and played around with <span class="highlight">Raspberry Pi SBCs</span>.
        My fascination of coding was there to stay during my highschool time, and I've probably spent more time programming during school time than paying attention.
        It was often hard to find motivation for projects though, so I have rather little to show for it.<br><br>
        As of now, I am studying to get certificates. I hope to work in the gaming industry, and have a dream to release my own game as an solo game developer.
        With that being said, I do look forward to working in the IT industry in general.  
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub">Skills</h2>
      <p>
        I can currently confidently code in <span class="highlight">python</span> and built simple websites with <span class="highlight">html</span>, <span class="highlight">css</span> and <span class="highlight">javascript</span>.
        I have made projects with <span class="highlight">Java</span> and <span class="highlight">C-Sharp</span> in the past, and plan on learning more about <span class="highlight">C-Sharp</span>.
        My next step, is getting certificates for these languages and building more projects using them, to showcase my competence.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub">Certificates</h2>
      <p>
        I currently do not posses a lot of certificates, but I did start with some basic ones. I plan on getting certificates in <span class="highlight">Databases</span>, <span class="highlight">Python</span> and <span class="highlight">C Sharp</span>.

        What? You already expect 20 years of experience for that junior-level job? Still working on it.
